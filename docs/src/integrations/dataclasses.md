# Dataclasses

The [`DataclassModel`][lakery.extra.dataclasses.DataclassModel] model can be used to
save standard Python dataclasses. For example, you might have a dataclass that holds the
results of a scientific experiment:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd


@dataclass
class ExperimentResults:
    measurements: pd.DataFrame
    image: np.ndarray
```

To turn this into a model that can be saved with Lakery, you need to inherit from
`DataclassModel` and declare a [`storage_model_id`](#storage-model-ids) as part of the
class definition:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses import field

from lakery.extra.dataclasses import DataclassModel
from lakery.extra.numpy import NpySerializer
from lakery.extra.pandas import DataFrameSerializer

npy_serializer = NpySerializer()
df_serializer = DataFrameSerializer()


@dataclass
class ExperimentResultsModel(DataclassModel, storage_model_id="..."):
    measurements: pd.DataFrame = field(metadata={"serializer": df_serializer})
    image: np.ndarray = field(metadata={"serializer": npy_serializer})
```

Note how the serializer for each field was specified through the `metadata` argument of
the `field` function. These could be infered automatically when serializing the model
but this takes time and can be unreliable. So, particularly in the case of dataclass
models where the structure is known ahead of time, it's recommended to be explicit.
Storages may also be specified in the same way under a `"storage"` key in the
`metadata`.

## Limitations

Serializers and storages may only be applied to fields as a whole. A serializer cannot
be applied to say, the elements of a list or the values of a dictionary within a field.
If you require this functionality you should consider Lakery's
[Pydantic integration](./pydantic.md) or implementing your own
[custom model](../concepts/models.md#custom-models).
