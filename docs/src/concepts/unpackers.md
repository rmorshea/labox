# Unpackers

Unpackers define how to destructure a [`Storable`](./storables.md) class into its
constituent parts as well as how to reconstitute it from those parts. Unpackers are
typically specialized for a specific set of `Storable` subclasses that share a common
framework. For example, all [Pydantic](../integrations/pydantic.md) classes use the same
unpacker, which understand how to convert Pydantic models into a dictionary of fields
and values. Unpackers live independently of the `Storable` classes so that the shape of
the data is defined independently of how it is stored and serialized. It also allows for
multiple versions of an unpacker to exist for backwards compatibility.

## Defining Unpackers

To define an unpacker you need to first decide what types of `Storable` classes it
should handle. Then you can implement the `Unpacker` interface, which requires you to
provide the following:

- `name` - a string that uniquely and permanently identifies the unpacker.
- `unpack_object` - a method that takes a `Storable` instance and returns a dictionary
    of fields with their values as well as where and how to store them.
- `repack_object` - a method that takes a `Storable` class and the aforementioned
    dictionary, and returns a new instance of the `Storable` class.

In the simplest case, this might look something like the following:

```python
from labox import UnpackedValue
from labox import Unpacker


class MyUnpacker(Unpacker):
    name = "my-unpacker@v1"

    def unpack_object(self, obj, registry):
        return {k: UnpackedValue(value=v) for k, v in obj.__dict__.items()}

    def repack_object(self, cls, contents, registry):
        return cls(**{k: u["value"] for k, u in contents.items()})
```

Then in your `Storable` class you can use this unpacker:

```python
from labox import Storable


class MyStorable(Storable, class_id="abc123", unpacker=MyUnpacker()): ...
```

All subclasses of `MyStorable` will now use the `MyUnpacker` to unpack and repack their
data.

## Content Names

Each [value](#unpacked-values) or [stream](#unpacked-streams) returned by an unpacker is
identified by a string within the unpacked dictionary. This string is called the
"content name". This string gets passed along to the
[`ContentRecord`](./database.md#content-records) that is saved as a pointer to the data.
The name is unique amongst all the content records for a given
[`ManifestRecord`](./database.md#manifest-records).

## Unpacked Values

When you unpack a `Storable` class, the values are returned as
[`UnpackedValue`][labox.core.unpacker.UnpackedValue] dicts. Each `UnpackedValue`
corresponds to a [`ContentRecord`](./database.md#content-records) in the database. These
values contain the following information:

- `value`: The actual value of the field.
- `serializer` (optional): The serializer to use when saving the value.
- `storage` (optional): The storage to use when saving the value.

If you do not specify a serializer. One will be inferred based on the type of the value.
If you do not specify a storage, the default storage in the given
[registry](./registry.md) will be used.

Unpacked values and value streams may be mixed within the same unpacked dictionary,
allowing you to unpack some fields into memory while streaming others.

## Unpacked Streams

In addition to unpacked values, you can also unpack the fields of a `Storable` class
into [`UnpackedValueStream`][labox.core.unpacker.UnpackedValueStream] dicts. Each
`UnpackedValueStream` corresponds to a [`ContentRecord`](./database.md#content-records)
in the database. An stream is useful when you can't or don't want to load large amounts
of data into memory at once. An `UnpackedValueStream` contains the following
information:

- `value_stream`: An async iterable that yields the values of the fields.
- `serializer` (recommended): The serializer to use when saving the values.
- `storage` (optional): The storage to use when saving the values.

Providing an explicit serializer is recommended because attempting to infer the
appropriate serializer will raise a late error since the first value from the stream
must be inspected. As before, if you do not specify a storage, the default storage in
the [registry](./registry.md) will be used.

Unpacked values and value streams may be mixed within the same unpacked dictionary,
allowing you to unpack some fields into memory while streaming others.

## Unpacker Names

Unpackers are identified by a globally unique name associated with each unpacker class
within a [registry](./registry.md#adding-unpackers). Once a unpacker has been used to
saved data this name must never be changed and the implementation of the unpacker must
always remain backwards compatible. If you need to change the implementation of a
unpacker you should create a new one with a new name. In order to continue loading old
data you'll have to preserve and registry the old unpacker.
