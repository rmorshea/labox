A data storage framework for Python.

## Todo

-   decouple serialization dumper/loader logic and storage writer/reader logic
    -   this will allow many to one relationships between dumpers/loaders and
        writers/readers
    -   this would allow for multiple storage writers can specify that they use a common
        reader
    -   for example, a file storage with multiple writers (e.g. different paths) ought
        to be able to use the same reader
